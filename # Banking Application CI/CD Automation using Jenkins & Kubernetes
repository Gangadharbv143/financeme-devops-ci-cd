## Project Overview
Designed and implemented an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Banking
application to automate build, containerization, image publishing,
and deployment on a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS EC2 instances.

## Tools & Technologies
- AWS EC2
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- Docker & DockerHub
- Kubernetes (kubeadm)
- Git & GitHub
- Linux (Ubuntu)

## Architecture
GitHub → Jenkins → Docker → DockerHub → Kubernetes (Master & Worker) → Banking App

(Add architecture diagram image here)

## CI/CD Workflow
1. Developer commits code to GitHub
2. Jenkins pipeline triggers automatically
3. Maven builds the banking application
4. Docker image is created and pushed to DockerHub
5. Kubernetes deploys the application using Deployment & Service YAML
6. Application is exposed using NodePort service

## Key Responsibilities
- Launched AWS EC2 instances for Kubernetes master and worker nodes
- Automated installation of Jenkins, Docker, Java, and Maven using Ansible
- Created Jenkins pipeline with multiple CI/CD stages
- Built and pushed Docker images to DockerHub
- Deployed banking application on Kubernetes cluster
- Validated deployment using kubectl commands

## Jenkins Pipeline Stages
- Git Checkout
- Build Application (Maven)
- Docker Image Build
- Docker Image Push
- Kubernetes Deployment

## Kubernetes Resources Used
- Deployment
- Service (NodePort)

## Outcome
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- Reduced manual deployment effort
- Successfully deployed banking application on Kubernetes
- Application accessible via browser using NodePort
